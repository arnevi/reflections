When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	- 	When working with other developers on e.g. a project, sharing code using GitHub very usefull 
		All developers can then pull and push files/code using GitHub, to stay updated on prosject and changes
    

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-	Too have control with what you pust to the remote repository.
		If this was done automatically you could end up pushing code you
		dont want too the remote repository. You also got a lot of unneccesary 
		pushes if this was done automatically.
